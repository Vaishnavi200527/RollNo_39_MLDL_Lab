        "### Key Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "For the OLS estimates to be unbiased and efficient, and for hypothesis testing to be valid, several assumptions are made:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the mean of the dependent variable is linear.\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Errors**: The errors (residuals) are independent of each other. This means there is no correlation between consecutive errors, which is often violated in time series data.\n",
        "3.  **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means the spread of residuals should be roughly the same along the regression line.\n",
        "4.  **Normality of Residuals**: The errors are normally distributed. This assumption is particularly important for constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests, especially with small sample sizes.\n",
        "5.  **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to estimate the individual coefficients reliably and interpret their effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Scenarios of Poor Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression, despite its simplicity and interpretability, has several limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Outliers (data points far from the regression line) can significantly influence the estimated coefficients, leading to a skewed model and inaccurate predictions. This is because OLS minimizes the sum of squared errors, giving more weight to larger errors.\n",
        "2.  **Inability to Model Non-Linear Relationships**: If the true relationship between variables is non-linear, a linear model will provide a poor fit. While transformations of variables (e.g., logarithmic, polynomial) can sometimes address this, the fundamental model remains linear in its parameters. Without appropriate transformations, the model will underperform.\n",
        "3.  **Assumptions Violations**: When the key assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, independence of errors, no multicollinearity) are significantly violated, the model's estimates can be biased, inefficient, or lead to incorrect inferences and predictions. For example:\n",
        "    *   **Heteroscedasticity**: If the variance of errors is not constant, the standard errors of the coefficients will be incorrect, affecting the reliability of hypothesis tests.\n",
        "    *   **Autocorrelation**: If errors are correlated (e.g., in time series), the standard errors will be underestimated, leading to overly optimistic p-values.\n",
        "    *   **Multicollinearity**: High correlation between independent variables makes it difficult to ascertain the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable. It can lead to unstable and counter-intuitive coefficient estimates.\n",
        "4.  **Limited to Continuous Dependent Variables**: Linear regression is inherently designed for predicting continuous numerical outcomes. It is not suitable for classification tasks or predicting categorical outcomes directly (Logistic Regression is used for that).\n",
        "5.  **Extrapolation Risks**: Predicting values outside the range of the observed independent variables (extrapolation) can be unreliable, as the linear relationship may not hold true beyond the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scenarios where it performs poorly:**\n",
        "*   When the underlying data generating process is inherently non-linear (e.g., exponential growth, saturation effects).\n",
        "*   When there are numerous outliers that are not handled appropriately.\n",
        "*   When predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity).\n",
        "*   When the dependent variable is categorical or binary.\n",
        "*   When error terms exhibit clear patterns (heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation)."

        "\n",
        "Based on the calculated metrics:\n",
        "*   **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 53.50**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors or deviations, i.e., the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It is a measure of the quality of an estimator—it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better. It penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: An MSE of 53.50 indicates that, on average, the squared difference between our model's predicted house prices and the actual house prices is 53.50. The units of MSE are the square of the target variable's units.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 7.31**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: RMSE is the square root of MSE. It is a commonly used measure of the differences between values predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed. The key advantage of RMSE is that it is in the same units as the target variable, making it more interpretable than MSE.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: An RMSE of 7.31 means that, on average, our model's predictions deviate from the actual house prices by approximately 7.31 units (e.g., 7.31 units of 'house price of unit area'). This gives a more intuitive understanding of the model's error magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **R-squared (R²): 0.68**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the model. It ranges from 0 to 1 (or sometimes negative for very poor fits), with higher values indicating a better fit. An R-squared of 0.68 means 68% of the variance in house prices is explained by our model.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: An R² score of 0.68 suggests that approximately 68% of the variability in the 'house price of unit area' can be explained by the features included in our linear regression model. The remaining 32% of the variance is unexplained by the model, possibly due to other unmeasured factors or inherent randomness. An R² of 0.68 is generally considered a reasonably good fit for many real-world datasets, indicating that the model captures a substantial portion of the underlying relationship."

        "### Hyperparameter Tuning in Simple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike more complex machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks), **simple Linear Regression models typically do not have hyperparameters that require tuning in the traditional sense.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Regression, especially when solved using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), is a closed-form solution. This means that the model's coefficients (the $\\beta$ values) are directly calculated using a mathematical formula, rather than being learned iteratively through optimization algorithms with adjustable parameters. The model itself determines the best-fit line based on the data, without external 'tuning' parameters affecting its learning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What could be considered 'hyperparameters' for Linear Regression are often related to the overall modeling process or regularization techniques:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net):** If we were to use regularized linear models (e.g., `Ridge`, `Lasso`, or `ElasticNet` from `sklearn.linear_model`), then the regularization strength (`alpha` for Ridge/Lasso, and `l1_ratio` for Elastic Net) would be hyperparameters that need tuning. These parameters control the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model weights small to prevent overfitting. However, for a basic `LinearRegression` model, these are not applicable.\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering:** The choice of features, transformations applied to features (e.g., polynomial features, logarithmic transformations), or interaction terms could be thought of as a form of 'hyperparameter' selection, as they significantly influence the model's performance. However, these are part of the feature engineering process, not inherent model hyperparameters.\n",
        "*   **Cross-validation:** While not a model hyperparameter, the choice of cross-validation strategy (e.g., number of folds `cv` in `KFold`) is a hyperparameter of the evaluation process. We have already performed K-fold cross-validation, which serves to robustly evaluate the model's generalization performance and provides insights into its stability across different subsets of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, for the `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` class, there are no primary hyperparameters to tune. The model's performance is largely dependent on the quality and characteristics of the input data and the inherent linearity of the relationship between features and the target."

        "The log-odds, also known as the logit function, is the logarithm of the odds. The odds of an event occurring are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ Odds = \\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)} = \\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{1 - P(Y=1|X)} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking the natural logarithm of the odds gives us the log-odds or logit:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{logit}(P(Y=1|X)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{1 - P(Y=1|X)}\\right) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, when you apply the logit function to the probability obtained from the sigmoid function, you recover the linear combination:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(Y=1|X)}{1 - P(Y=1|X)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_nx_n $$\n",
        "\n",
        "This shows that Logistic Regression models the *log-odds* of the dependent variable as a linear combination of the independent variables. This is why it's considered a generalized linear model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "While less restrictive than Linear Regression, Logistic Regression also has several assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Binary Outcome**: The dependent variable must be binary (two outcomes).\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Observations**: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
        "3.  **No Multicollinearity**: Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to unstable and misleading estimates of coefficients.\n",
        "4.  **Linearity of Log-Odds**: There must be a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable. This is a crucial assumption. While the relationship between predictors and the probability of the outcome is non-linear (due to the sigmoid function), the relationship between predictors and the log-odds is linear.\n",
        "5.  **Large Sample Size**: Logistic regression requires a relatively large sample size, especially if there are many predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Scenarios of Poor Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Assumption of Linearity in Log-Odds**: The most significant limitation is the assumption that the independent variables are linearly related to the log-odds of the outcome. If this assumption is violated, the model's predictive power will be severely limited. Unlike linear regression, you cannot simply look at a scatter plot of X vs. Y to check for linearity, but rather X vs. log-odds of Y.\n",
        "2.  **Inability to Handle Non-Linear Relationships (without Feature Engineering)**: If the actual relationship between features and the outcome is complex and non-linear, Logistic Regression will perform poorly unless proper feature engineering (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms) is applied to capture these non-linearities.\n",
        "3.  **Sensitivity to Multicollinearity**: Similar to Linear Regression, high multicollinearity among independent variables can make the coefficients difficult to interpret and lead to an unstable model.\n",
        "4.  **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Outliers, especially in the feature space, can significantly affect the model's coefficients and predictions, as the optimization process (often maximum likelihood estimation) can be sensitive to extreme values.\n",
        "5.  **Requires Adequate Data for Each Outcome**: If the dataset has very few observations for one of the outcome classes (imbalanced classes), the model might struggle to learn effectively for the minority class, leading to poor predictions for that class.\n",
        "6.  **Sparse Data and Overfitting**: With a large number of features, especially if many are irrelevant or if the data is sparse (many zero values), Logistic Regression can be prone to overfitting, particularly with smaller datasets.\n",
        "7.  **Does Not Automatically Handle Missing Values**: Like many statistical models, Logistic Regression requires all input features to be numerical and without missing values. Proper imputation or handling of missing data is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scenarios where it performs poorly:**\n",
        "*   When the decision boundary between classes is inherently non-linear and no feature engineering is applied to capture it.\n",
        "*   When there is severe multicollinearity among predictor variables.\n",
        "*   When the dataset has highly imbalanced classes, without proper handling (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, using class weights).\n",
        "*   When the number of features is very high relative to the number of samples, especially without regularization.\n",
        "*   When the problem requires capturing complex, non-monotonic relationships between features and the probability of the outcome."

        "5.  **Data Preprocessing - Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
        "6.  **Combine Processed Features**: The scaled numerical features and one-hot encoded categorical features are combined into a single, comprehensive feature set (`X_loan_preprocessed`).\n",
        "7.  **Data Splitting**: The preprocessed data (`X_loan_preprocessed`, `y_loan`) is divided into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.\n",
        "8.  **Model Training**: (To be performed in the next steps) A Logistic Regression model will be trained on the `X_loan_train` and `y_loan_train` datasets.\n",
        "9.  **Prediction**: (To be performed in the next steps) The trained model will make predictions on the `X_loan_test` dataset.\n"

        "*   **Accuracy: 0.86 (86%)**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. It tells us how many of the loan applications (both approved and rejected) were correctly classified by the model.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: An accuracy of 86% means that the model correctly predicted the loan approval status for 86% of the applicants in the test set. While generally good, accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Precision: 0.86 (86%)**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. In the context of loan approval, it tells us, \"Of all the loans that the model predicted would be *approved*, how many actually *were* approved?\" High precision means a low false positive rate (i.e., fewer applicants incorrectly approved).\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: A precision of 86% indicates that when the model predicts a loan will be approved, it is correct 86% of the time. This is important for a financial institution to avoid approving loans to applicants who should have been rejected, thus minimizing potential financial risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Recall: 0.93 (93%)**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: Recall (also known as Sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It tells us, \"Of all the loans that *should have been approved*, how many did the model correctly *approve*?\" High recall means a low false negative rate (i.e., fewer applicants incorrectly rejected).\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: A recall of 93% suggests that the model successfully identified 93% of all loans that were actually approved. This is crucial for a financial institution as missing out on approving creditworthy applicants can lead to lost business opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **F1-Score: 0.89 (89%)**\n",
        "    *   **What it represents**: The F1-Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. It tries to find the balance between precision and recall, especially useful when there is an uneven class distribution. A high F1-Score indicates that the model has good values for both precision and recall.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: An F1-Score of 89% indicates a strong balance between the precision and recall of the model. This means the model is generally good at both correctly identifying approved loans and not incorrectly approving too many non-approved loans. Given the potential costs of false positives (bad loans) and false negatives (missed good loans), a balanced metric like F1-score is often very informative in financial applications."

An RMSE of 7.31 suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by about 7.31 units from the actual house prices. The cross-validation scores show some variability (standard deviation 0.10), indicating that the model's performance might fluctuate slightly with different subsets of data, though the mean R-squared of 0.59 is still reasonable.\n",

        "    *   **Interpretability:** The coefficients ($\beta$ values) are easy to understand, representing the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, assuming all other variables are constant. This makes it straightforward to understand feature importance.\n",
        "    *   **Simplicity and Speed:** Relatively simple to implement and computationally efficient, especially for datasets with many features.\n",
        "    *   **Good Baseline:** Often serves as a good baseline model for regression problems.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Assumes Linearity:** Performs poorly if the relationship between features and the target is non-linear, as evidenced by an R-squared of 0.68, indicating a significant portion of variance remains unexplained, potentially due to non-linear relationships not captured.\n",
        "    *   **Sensitive to Outliers:** Outliers can heavily influence the regression line, leading to biased coefficients and inaccurate predictions (as discussed in its theoretical limitations).\n",
        "    *   **Assumes Homoscedasticity and Normality of Residuals:** Violations of these assumptions can lead to incorrect inferences and less reliable confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Logistic Regression\n",
        "*   **Strengths:**\n",
        "    *   **Handles Binary Outcomes Effectively:** Specifically designed for binary classification, providing probabilities that are intuitive to interpret.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretability (Log-Odds):** The coefficients represent the change in the log-odds of the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, offering insights into how features influence the likelihood of the positive class.\n",
        "    *   **Robustness:** Can be quite robust, especially with regularization (like the `C` parameter in `liblinear` solver), which helps prevent overfitting.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Assumes Linearity of Log-Odds:** If the relationship between features and the log-odds of the outcome is not linear, the model's performance will suffer. This requires careful feature engineering or transformations.\n",
        "    *   **Limited to Binary/Multinomial Outcomes:** Not directly applicable to continuous regression problems.\n",
        "    *   **Sensitivity to Multicollinearity:** High correlation between independent variables can lead to unstable and counter-intuitive coefficient estimates, making interpretation difficult.\n",
        "    *   **Requires Sufficient Data:** Can perform poorly with highly imbalanced datasets if not handled with techniques like class weighting or over/under-sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This comprehensive machine learning experiment successfully demonstrated the application of Linear Regression for a regression task (predicting house prices) and Logistic Regression for a classification task (predicting loan approval status) within the Google Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "For **Linear Regression**, the model explained a substantial portion (68%) of the variance in house prices, providing reasonable predictions with an RMSE of 7.31. Its interpretability allows for clear insights into the factors influencing housing prices. However, the performance could likely be improved by exploring non-linear relationships or more advanced models if the underlying data suggests such complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "For **Logistic Regression**, the model achieved strong classification metrics, notably an F1-score of 0.89 and a high recall of 0.93 for loan approval prediction. This indicates its effectiveness in identifying creditworthy applicants while maintaining a good balance of overall correctness. The hyperparameter tuning step confirmed that the model was already well-performing, suggesting the data's characteristics align well with Logistic Regression's assumptions or that the default parameters were suitable. The confusion matrix visually reinforced the model's ability to distinguish between approved and rejected loans with high accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, both algorithms proved effective for their respective problem types, showcasing their utility in real-world scenarios. Linear Regression provides a transparent approach to predicting continuous values, while Logistic Regression offers a robust method for binary classification. The experiment highlighted the importance of appropriate model selection based on the target variable type and the problem's nature, as well as the value of data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter tuning in developing reliable machine learning solutions."

        "    *   Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` for `C` and `solver` resulted in an optimal F1-score of 0.8866, which was very similar to the initial model's performance, suggesting the default or initial parameters were already robust for this dataset.\n",
        "    *   The confusion matrix for the tuned model showed 2545 True Negatives, 6353 True Positives, 1058 False Positives, and 444 False Negatives. This indicates that the model generated more false positives (incorrectly approved loans) than false negatives (incorrectly rejected loans).\n",

        "*   **Resolve Kaggle API Authentication:** It is crucial to address the persistent `kaggle.json` authentication issue to ensure reproducibility and seamless execution of Kaggle-dependent tasks across different Colab sessions or environments.\n",
        "*   **Enhance Linear Regression for Taipei Housing:** Given the R-squared of 0.68, further exploration of non-linear relationships, polynomial features, or interaction terms could improve the model's ability to explain more variance in house prices.\n",
        "*   **Strategically Adjust Logistic Regression Threshold:** The higher rate of False Positives (1058) in the Loan Approval model suggests a potential risk for the financial institution. Depending on the relative costs of false positives (approving a bad loan) versus false negatives (missing a good loan), adjusting the classification probability threshold could be beneficial to reduce false approvals.\n"
